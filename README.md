Just an everyday normal guy who likes to build things.

- Yes, I use Vim. But on IDEs (because why not have the best of both worlds?).
- Currently learning Go (because who doesnâ€™t love a good gopher?)
- Open to collaborating on anything that piques my interest (or yours!)
- You can reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shivam-parihar/)
- Just in case I pique your interest, here's my [Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hhCr0Zbmvp8g9_KN5lkNZCMJrsfso_gY/view?usp=sharing). Yes, I am looking for work. But GitHub speaks for me too, so this resume link might be redundant. Even this sentence is redundant. Ahh :cry I think I should probably stop here before I ramble on forever.
